#  rsh â€” Mostly workable shell

**rsh** ...you're average rust shell written by an idiot (deadass)
---



##  Features

- It works? (if it even compiled correctly)
- uhhh works like other sh? mostly? me thinks?

---

##  Installation 

```anywhere
git clone https://github.com/Rusting-stuff/rsh.git
cd rsh
cargo build --release 
#pray it even builds and works correctly
cp .rshrc ~/.rshrc 
#try to customize it from the .rshrc there is a lot of comments
``` 
pretty sure thats all minus you needing to manually execute it? (use it if ya want ;])
